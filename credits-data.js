      "I've loved games since I can remember and love to come up with new ideas and create fun experiences. I've been involved in game development since I was in middleschool, first making things for Newgrounds and trying to get through to the website - these were all bad dressup monster games, weird story's and a few attempts at animations. Game design was clearly the only option after highschool graduation so I went a community college to take game design and flash programming. After 3 years and several internships I graduated with 2 degrees and landed myself a job making lottery games - first as part of a small team and eventually being bought out and working for one of the largest players in the lottery industry. I was burnt out and didn't enjoy my job any more as the culture at larger companies wasn't a good fit for me. I pivoted and took my experience with game design and development and joined another small team - but this time making elearning software. Here I focused on honing my skills, while I kept picking away at game development in my spare time. As generative technology really hit the scene in 2022 - I imedpently jumped on it as I saw the huge potential for my game development and it's ability to get past the largest hurdle I kept facing with my personal projects. I tend to hyper focus, and when I'm doing something it's all I think about - but I can only keep it up for a few weeks at most, and if I keep pushing myself past that (2 - 3 - 4 months) then I get burnt out and end up crashing. This would lead to 6 month periods where I didn't even want to think about game development and I'd question if I'd ever be able to follow my dreams or if I'd just accept that it wasn't for me. I felt a lot of self doubt, and a huge amount of imposter syndrome.",
